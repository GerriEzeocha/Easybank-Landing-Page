# Frontend Mentor - Easybank landing page

![Design preview for the Easybank landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This was a front-end coding challenge, from Frontend Mentor

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible, using any tools I'd like.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
